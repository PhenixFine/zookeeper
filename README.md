# zookeeper
Stage 2 of 4 for JetBrains Academy - Kotlin - [Zookeeper project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/196/stages/976/implement).   
Prints the contents of the camel.txt file ( wasn't required to load from file, but I wanted some extra practice with files ).
## Requirements
### Description
One of the most important parts of working with animals is keeping an eye on them. We need to see the animals on the screen to know how they are doing, right? Now we are ready to print something awesome: an image of an animal!
### Objectives
For the second stage, you will need to develop an animal printer. Your program should display the animal identified in the code field.
### Example
Your output should contain the following ASCII image:
